// Basics:

// - In SwiftUI, you build a UI with Views and then you change those views with Modifiers.
// - Views can be organized in containers. Some containers organize views in one direction. This is called Stack.
//
// We have stacks like:
// - Vertical Stack or as SwiftUI calls it, a “VStack”.
// - There is another stack that can organize views horizontally. SwiftUI calls this horizontal stack an HStack.
// - Another stack view will organize your views so they are one on top of another. This is called the Depth Stack or ZStack.

// It is beneficial to know that Apple refers to child views that have no children of their own as “leaf views”.
