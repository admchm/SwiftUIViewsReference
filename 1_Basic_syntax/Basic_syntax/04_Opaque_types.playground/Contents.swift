// Opaque types:

// The keyword some is specifying that it is an opaque type (“opaque”, when referring to languages, means “hard or impossible to understand.”)
// In the code example, it is “hard or impossible to understand” which type of view is being returned but at least you know it is a view.
// In this case, it is OK with just knowing that some View is being returned and can use that view to draw the screen.
